# ct-random-walker

A small C++ project using the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) by [OneLoneCoder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder).

The program draws a random walker each 10 seconds. The positon, color and type of walker is random. I programed this to get a better understanding of C++ Standard Libraies and make some random art!

## Types of walker
1. Random direction step size always 1
1. Random direction with Levy-Flight
1. Diffusion-Limited Aggregation
